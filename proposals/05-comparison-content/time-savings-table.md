## Weekly Time Savings Projection

For a typical developer performing these tasks:

| Daily Activity | Frequency | Traditional Time | JIRA Assistant | Daily Savings |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Standup prep | 1x | 2.5 min | 0.2 min | **2.3 min** |
| Check assigned issues | 3x | 1.5 min | 0.25 min | **1.25 min** |
| Update statuses | 5x | 1.0 min | 0.35 min | **0.65 min** |
| Log time | 3x | 1.5 min | 0.4 min | **1.1 min** |
| Search for issues | 4x | 2.0 min | 0.5 min | **1.5 min** |
| Add comments | 4x | 1.3 min | 0.4 min | **0.9 min** |

**Daily Total: ~7.7 minutes saved**

| Weekly Projection | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Daily savings | 7.7 minutes |
| Work days per week | 5 |
| **Weekly savings** | **38.5 minutes** |
| Monthly savings (4 weeks) | 2.6 hours |
| **Annual savings** | **31 hours** |

## Team-Scale Impact

For a team of 8 developers:

| Metric | Individual | Team of 8 |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Weekly time saved | 38.5 min | 5.1 hours |
| Monthly time saved | 2.6 hours | 20.5 hours |
| **Annual time saved** | **31 hours** | **248 hours** |
| Equivalent work days | 4 days | 31 days |

**Additional team benefits not quantified:**
- Reduced context switching
- Lower cognitive load (no JQL memorization)
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- Consistent JIRA hygiene
- Better cross-project visibility

## Complexity-Adjusted Savings

Some tasks have greater cognitive overhead in traditional approaches:

| Task Complexity | Traditional Overhead | JIRA Assistant Advantage |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Simple** (view, search) | Low - familiar patterns | Modest speedup (2-3x) |
| **Medium** (transitions, links) | Medium - need to remember syntax | Good speedup (3-5x) |
| **Complex** (bulk ops, JQL) | High - error-prone, multi-step | Best speedup (5-10x) |
| **Expert** (cross-project, analytics) | Very high - requires deep knowledge | Massive speedup (10-20x) |

The higher the complexity, the greater the JIRA Assistant advantage.

## Usage Notes

1. **Conservative Estimates:** Times are based on experienced users. New users would see even greater improvements with JIRA Assistant.

2. **Measurement Methodology:**
   - UI times include navigation, clicking, waiting for page loads
   - CLI times include typing complete commands and parsing output
   - JIRA Assistant times include natural language input and Claude's response

3. **Variables Not Included:**
   - Network latency (affects all methods equally)
   - JIRA instance performance
   - Learning curve for new users (significantly higher for JQL/CLI)

4. **Customization:** Adjust percentages based on your team's actual measurements if you gather data.

5. **Presentation Options:**
   - Use the primary table for README (clear, impactful)
   - Use detailed breakdowns for documentation or proposals
   - Use weekly projections for ROI discussions
